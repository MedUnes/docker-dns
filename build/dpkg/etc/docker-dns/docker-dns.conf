# Configuration file for the Docker DNS Resolver application
# Each setting follows the KEY=VALUE format. Ensure there are no spaces around '='.

# PORT: The port number the DNS server listens on.
# Default: 5335
# Change this value if another service (e.g., a DNS server) is already using this port.
PORT=5335

# TTL: Time-to-live (in seconds) for cached DNS records.
# Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
# Use a higher value for less frequent updates (better performance),
# or a lower value for more real-time accuracy.
TTL=300

# TLD: The top-level domain used for resolving Docker container names.
# Example:
# - If TLD=docker and a container's name is "myapp",
#   queries to "myapp.docker" will resolve to the container's IP.
TLD=docker

# DEFAULT_RESOLVER: A comma-separated list of fallback DNS servers.
# These are used when a query cannot be resolved via Docker-based DNS.
# Examples:
# - 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
# - 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS)
# - 127.0.0.1 (Local DNS server)
#
# Notes:
# - Specify multiple servers to provide redundancy (e.g., DEFAULT_RESOLVER=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1).
# - To use a local DNS server for non-Docker queries, add its IP address here (e.g., 127.0.0.1).
DEFAULT_RESOLVER=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1,8.8.4.4
